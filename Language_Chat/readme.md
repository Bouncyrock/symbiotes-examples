Language chat is meant to allow anyone to write a chat message in "a certain language" and have it only be legible for other players that speak that language.

# Usage
It is mostly meant as a tool for GMs to convey information to players like having a letter that is in a language that only some can read, however it can also be used by players to talk with each other in a language that only some can understand.
It will send the chat message to everyone on the board, no matter whether they have the Symbiote open or even installed **(Disclaimer for Alpha release: They do need to have the Symbiote update, so have to also be in the Alpha)**.
It will select from three variants:
1. The original sender gets a chat message with the readable text as well as a note with what language it was sent as.
2. Players who understand that language get the plain text message
3. Players who don't understand the language get a randomized text. Whitespace is preserved (so words are the same length) and punctuation/special characters are kept as punctuation/special characters, however they are also randomized. This means a letter will always remain a letter, but will be a random one while a period will always be either a period, exclamation mark, question mark, etc but never a letter.

*Note: The same randomized text is sent to everyone who doesn't understand it, they don't get unique randomized texts.*

# Limitations
The language chat Symbiote requires everyone who intends to use it to keep track of who knows which language themselves, as this information is not networked. Additionally there is only a distinction between "player X doesn't know this language" and "player X is fluent in this language", which does not cover "they can't understand it, but they can recognize which language it is".
