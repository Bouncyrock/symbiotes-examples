To roll something with "advantage" or "disadvantage" (which is simply a "keep highest of two" and "keep lowest of two"), click on the respective buttons. Nothing has to be entered into the text fields, it will default to naming the roll "Check" (and adding "(Adv)" or "(Disadv)" depending on the roll type at the end) and using a d20 for the roll.
A custom name and custom dice roll can be entered, where the dice roll can be as many or as few dice and modifiers as you want. The buttons will duplicate the roll into two groups and then either keep the higher of the results or the lower.

If only you want/need to roll with advantage/disadvantage only you need to have the Symbiote. All other players will receive the custom dice results even without the Symbiote running **(Disclaimer for Alpha release: They do need to have the Symbiote update, so have to also be in the Alpha)**. The Symbiote supports running in the background, so you only need it open if you need a new dice group, repeatedly rolling an existing one will continue rolling with advantage/disadvantage for as long as the Symbiote isn't explicitly being shut down.
