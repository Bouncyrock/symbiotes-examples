This Symbiote allows sending stylized notes to other clients with the same Symbiote. Any player that is in GM mode can draft a note and send it to all other clients connected to the same board. A note can either be text with a specific font, or a URL to an image.

The Notes Symbiote has to be running for any client that wants to receive notes, but it can be in the background. If it is currently in the background while a new note is received, it will send a clickable notification to the user that a new note has been received.

Due to the networked nature you won't see much happening on your end/if being the only one in the board, this Symbiote requires other people to be online to be useful.
